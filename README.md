## 🧠 About Me
👋 Hi! I’m Upendra Uddagiri, a Computer Science Engineering student who is passionate about learning, experimenting, and building things from scratch.

I enjoy understanding how things work behind the scenes—from writing clean Python code to training machine learning models and analyzing data. Instead of just following tutorials, I focus on hands-on practice, building small and medium projects that strengthen my fundamentals and problem-solving ability.
My interests weave together:

-💻 Programming & Problem Solving
-🤖 Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
-🧠 Building practical projects
-📊 Data analysis & automation
-⚽ Playing football
-🚴 Cycling

I believe in leveraging technology to create meaningful, efficient, and scalable systems that improve lives and businesses.
